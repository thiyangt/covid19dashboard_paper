**Abstract**

As of September 20th, 2021, 221 countries and territories are infected by the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. Dashboards are the most often used visualization method for visualizing COVID-19 data and informing the public. The main objective of this study is to identify different features, visualization methods & improvements that should be occurred by exploring the existing dashboards and to develop a dashbored to visualize COVID-19 outbreak in Sri Lanka. We explored 15 different dashboards. The most commonly used visualization methods in dashboard development are bar charts, line charts, and interactive maps. Dashboards that fit on a single screen are preferable than others.

# Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic is a global coronavirus illness outbreak that began in 2019 and is being caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. In December 2019, the first COVID-19-infected patient was discovered in Wuhan, China. According to Worldmeter data, there were 229835231 confirmed cases, 206515718 recovered cases, 18605877 active cases, and 4713636 deaths worldwide as of September 20, 2021. Currently, 99.5 percent of active patients are in a mild state, while 0.5 percent are in a critical state.

Dashboards are one of the greatest visual interpretation methods for tracking the COVID-19 pandemic's spread and communication. There are a plethora of COVID-19 visualization dashboards that have been designed to visualize the pandemic's global and local status. Different software can be used to generate dashboards. We explored 15 dashboards designed to visualize COVID-19 data in the global and country levels. First, dashboards were compared to identify the various features, visualization approaches, and enhancements that should be implemented. Next, we developed an interactive dashboard to visualized COVID-19 outbreak in Sri Lanka.

# Literature Review

Initially 15 dashboards were compared  to determine which data types are most frequently shown in dashboards. The 15 dashboards we used in the study are listed below (Table 1).

As shown in table 02 all dashboards which are considered in this paper represent the data related to COVID-19 confirmed cases, recovered cases & deaths. There have been contained vaccination details, 8 dashboards out of 15 dashboards. In almost each & every dashboard, value boxes have been used to represent these total figures. Bar charts & line charts (trend lines) are most frequently used to visualize these data (confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths & vaccination details) with respect to time. A Majority of dashboards presented data by daily or weekly. The mapping is used to track the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases by country/ provincial/ regional etc. When visualizing the data by map color code system & circles with respect to the size of the cases have been used to visualize the variation in size. The considerable number of dashboards has been used doughnut shape pie charts to represent total COVID-19 confirmed cases, recovered cases, active cases & deaths as a percentage. Also, region, gender, age group & ethnicity can be identified as common breakdowns of COVID-19 cases. In some dashboard has been added data tables for representing cases distribution by province/region.  Only very few dashboards have been visualized in COVID-19 test details. Only 6 dashboards have been compared to global situations. In addition, fatality rate, incidence rate, ICU beds, stage of the patients & hospitalize details have been contained in the several dashboards. These are the most common data types that have been contained in the dashboards. The main tools that have been used for different purpose can be shown in the following table.\hfill\break

### 2.2 Comparison of Dashboards

Before developing a dashboard, it is necessary to think about which visualization tools & features that should be contained in the dashboards. What are the most suitable plots, how many panels in the dashboard, what data should be included, how to fit dashboard on a screen, colors & is it real time updated or not are the common things that should be considered before develop the dashboards. In table 02 has been compared these visualization tools & features under the following categories. 

  * Number of panels - How many panels which are included in the dashboard.
  * Visualization tools – what are the graphical representations of data which are contained in the dashboards. 
  * Fitted on a single screen – whether the dashboard fits on a single screen or not (users can see the whole dashboard on a single screen without adjusting through grid overlay or not).
  * Color theme – is there a unique color used for one data type in the whole dashboard (i.e.: one color scale for one data type everywhere on the dashboard). 
  * Dark background – background color of the dashboard is dark or light.
  * Data available – whether users can be downloaded/available the data set which has been visualized on the dashboard. 
  * Real time updated – whether the dashboard is updated daily/ specific time (live dashboard) or not.

As shown in table 04 almost each & every dashboard, line charts & bar charts have been used to visualize the data. Heat map & dot plot has been used only one dashboard. Only four dashboards have been fitted with a single screen. The majority of dashboards have used color theme on the whole dashboard. That is, dashboards have been applied different colors for different type of data (i.e. One specific color for confirmed cases, another color for deaths, etc.) in the whole dashboard. The data set & related links have available on some dashboards & users can download these data sets. There are 6 dashboards with dark background while others have been used light background. Last updated time & date of the latest available data  has been reported at the top or bottom of the first panel in the dashboard. Like, half of dashboards included all data in one panel.

# Discussion and Further research


Bar charts & line charts are the most frequently used tools for the visualization of total cases, daily cases & comparisons with respect to time. Some dashboards contained doughnut shape pie charts to summarize the total figures. In almost each and every dashboard, value boxes have been used to represent total figures. Some dashboards contained interactive maps & data tables to visualize the distribution of cases by country, province, region or state. All dashboards are daily updating real time dashboards. Gender, age groups and ethnicity can be identified as common breakdowns. The data sets & related links are available on most of the dashboards & can be downloaded. It can be seen that it is very easy, clear and user friendly to identify confirmed, recovered and deceased cases in dashboards which include one color theme for the whole dashboard. Dashboards with the dark background are more comfortable to the eyes than dashboards with light background & light colors. Also, it is better if the dashboard can be fitted on a single screen rather than adjusting through a grid overlay.


# Appendix: Overview of reviewed dashboard

Real time updated COVID-19 dashboard created by the John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science & Engineering (JHU CSSE) has included total confirmed cases & total deaths by country, province/region/state (not for all countries)[6]. Weekly & daily global confirmed cases, deaths & vaccine doses have been visualized using bar plots related to the date in the side panels. Also, an interactive world map has included in the dashboard to represent total confirmed cases, incidence rate, fatality ratio & vaccine doses administered by country & state of US. All the links related to the data sets has been included in the dashboard. In this dashboard red, white, green colors has been used to indicate confirmed cases, deaths & vaccine doses respectively. The dashboard has fitted on a single screen.
