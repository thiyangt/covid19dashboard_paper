**Abstract**

As of September 20th, 2021, 221 countries and territories are infected by the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. Dashboards are the most often used visualization method for visualizing COVID-19 data and informing the public.  We explored 15 different dashboards. 


**Keywords:** Visualization, multiple time series, heatmap, COVID-19 vaccine, flexdashboard

# Introduction

COVID-19 has expanded over the globe, having a significant impact on our daily lives and work. Early responses and timely decisions and actions are critical to saving communities and economies worldwide. Data is essential in order to make effective decisions. Data-driven information guides the decision-making process and also evaluates the effectiveness of strategies taken.

Massive amounts of data are being generated in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this available data, it is critical to create tools for exploratory analysis for policymakers, health officials, and the general public. Dashboards are one of the greatest visual interpretation methods for tracking the COVID-19 pandemic's spread and vaccine administration. Dashboards allow users to quickly interact with a combination of exploratory visualizations and gain a quick overview of the data. This paper describes the development and implementation of a dashboard for the COVID-19 outbreak and vaccine administration data in Sri Lanka.

There are a plethora of COVID-19 visualization dashboards that have been designed to visualize the pandemic's global and local status. Different software can be used to generate dashboards. We explored 15 dashboards designed to visualize COVID-19 data at the global and country levels. First, dashboards were compared to identify the various features, visualization approaches, and enhancements that should be implemented. Next, we developed an interactive dashboard to visualize the COVID-19 outbreak and vaccination information in Sri Lanka. This dashboard provides front-line health officers a situational awareness of the spread of COVID-19 and the status of the vaccination program.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: [Section 2](#litreview) of dashboards created using data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. [Section 3](#methods) presents the methodology and basic design concept; [Section 4](#results) presents the results; and [Section 5](# conclusion) concludes.

# Literature Review {#litreview}

Dashboards are one of the best visual interpretation methods for tracking the spread and communication of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 15 dashboards we used in the literature survey are listed in Table 1. We compared dashboards to identify data types, plotting techniques, colour themes, and other features such as interactivity on plots and panel numbers.

Table 02 summarizes the data types that are most frequently shown in dashboards. As shown in Table 02, all dashboards which are considered in this paper represent the data related to COVID-19 confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths. There were 8 dashboards out of 15 dashboards that contained vaccination details.

Table 03 highlights the dashboard visualization techniques. Value boxes have been utilized to display total figures on practically every dashboard. The most common ways of visualizing confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths, and immunization details are bar charts and line charts (trend lines). The majority of dashboards displayed data on a daily or weekly basis. The spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases by country, province, regional, and other factors is tracked using choropleth maps. When visualizing the data by the map color code system, circles with respect to the size of the cases have been used to visualize the variation in size. Several dashboards use doughnut-shaped pie charts to indicate total COVID-19 confirmed cases, recovered cases, active cases, and deaths as a proportion. Furthermore, region, gender, age group, and ethnicity can be identified as common breakdowns of COVID-19 cases. Data tables for representing cases' distribution by province/region have been added to some dashboards. Very few dashboards have been visualized in the COVID-19 test details. Only 6 dashboards have been compared to global situations. In addition, the fatality rate, incidence rate, ICU beds, stage of the patients, and hospitalized details have been contained in the several dashboards.\hfill\break

## Comparison of Dashboards

Before developing a dashboard, it is necessary to think about which visualization tools and features should be contained in the dashboard. What are the most suitable plots, how many panels in the dashboard, what data should be included, how to fit the dashboard on a screen, colors, and is it real time updated or not are the common things that should be considered before developing the dashboards. Table 4 summarizes information under the following categories:

  i. Number of panels - How many panels are included in the dashboard.
  ii. Visualization tools â€“ what are the graphical representations of data. 
  iii. Fitted on a single screen â€“ whether the dashboard fits on a single screen or not (users can see the whole dashboard on a single screen without adjusting through grid overlay or not).
  iv. Color theme â€“ is there a unique color used for one data type in the whole dashboard (i.e.: one color scale for one data type everywhere on the dashboard). 
  v. Dark background â€“ the background color of the dashboard is dark or light.
  vi. Data available â€“ whether users can downloaded or whether data is available to reproduce the results. 
  vii. Real time updated â€“ whether the dashboard is updated daily/ specific time (live dashboard) or not.

As listed in Table 4, on almost each and every dashboard, line charts and bar charts have been used to visualize the data. The heat map and dot plot were only used on one dashboard. Only four dashboards have been fitted with a single screen. The majority of dashboards use a color theme on the whole dashboard. That is, dashboards have been applied with different colors for different types of data (i.e., one specific color for confirmed cases, another color for deaths, etc.) across the whole dashboard. The data set and related links are available on some dashboards, and users can download these data sets. There are 6 dashboards with a dark background, while others have a light background. The last updated time and date of the latest available data has been reported at the top or bottom of the first panel in the dashboard. Half of the dashboards included all the information in a single panel. 

# Methodology {#method}

## Data

We obtained data from COVID-19 situation reports published by the Epidemiology Unit, Ministry of Health Sri Lanka. The data includes the number of death cases, number of hospitalized cases, number of recovered cases, and COVID-19 vaccinated counts in Sri Lanka. The data is made available through an open-source R package covid19srilanka [@talagala]. 

## Design and development

R software was used for data cleaning and analysis. The flexdashboard [@flexdashboard] package was used to build the data visualization dashboard. The initial layout for the dashboard was prepared based on @rami. Data visualizations are generated using ggplot2 [@ggplot2] and plotly [@plotly] packages in R.  we used color-blind friendly colour palettes for the graphics. To represent qualitative data, a diverging colour palette was used, and to represent numeric variables, a sequential colour theme was used. Table 5 provides an overview of methods that have been used to visualize data.

**Table 5: Data visualization approaches used to visualize data**

|Spread of COVID-19 around the world      | Choropleth maps \hfill\break



We now describe the novel visualization approaches we included in out dashboard. To effectively distribute the vaccine and to support situational awareness and inform policy makers decision making it is important to know the district-wise spread of COVID-19 cases.  We have daily COVID-19 data related to confirmed cases in all 25 districts in Sri Lanka. This structure generates a multiple time series collection. Visualizing these time series data is useful to identify similarities and dissimilarities between districts and their general trends. There are two approaches to visualizing these time series: (i) drawing individual time series plots for each district (as shown in Figure 2), and (ii) simultaneously plots all time series on a single panel (as shown in Figure 3). Plotting all time series simultaneously is also not possible due to overlapping time series and scale differences. Plotting separate panels for each district is not effective. The reason is that it is hard to compare across 25 different panels at once. In order to overcome these problems in multiple time series visualization,  we use heat maps ((@peng2008method)) to visualize global and local similarities and dissimilarities across districts. The associated results are shown in Figure 3. Here two heatmaps are used to show the global variations (Figure 3: A) and local variation (Figure 3: B) in the time series collection. Figure 3-A cell colours represent the actual counts of the COVID-19 confirmed cases. This is useful to get an idea about the differences in absolute values. Figure 3-B cell colours represent the normalized values created applying the min-max transformation. Min-max transformation is applied to each district time series by using the corresponding district minimum and maximum value of the time series. This helps us to get an idea about patterns within districts. For example, according to Figure 3A we can see Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara districs COVID-19 cases are significantly higher than other districts. According to Figure 3B all districts show an increasing trend pattern as the right-hand side of the cells are lighter than the left-hand side cells in the heat map. Furthermore according to Figure 3B all districts reported high number of cases on  19, 24, 29 August, 2021. Figure 3B is useful for identifying these local outlying behaviours. As shown in Figure 4, we also use Choropleth map and Dorling cartogram to visualize spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases. The vaccination information are visualize through interactive time series plots and bar charts. A screenshot of associated panels are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6.

# Discussion and Further research {#conclusions}


Bar charts and line charts are the most frequently used tools for the visualization of total cases, daily cases and comparisons with respect to time. Some dashboards contained doughnut shape pie charts to summarize the total figures. In almost each and every dashboard, value boxes have been used to represent total figures. Some dashboards contained interactive maps & data tables to visualize the distribution of cases by country, province, region or state. All dashboards are daily updating real time dashboards. Gender, age groups and ethnicity can be identified as common breakdowns. The data sets & related links are available on most of the dashboards & can be downloaded. It can be seen that it is very easy, clear and user friendly to identify confirmed, recovered and deceased cases in dashboards which include one color theme for the whole dashboard. Dashboards with the dark background are more comfortable to the eyes than dashboards with light background & light colors. Also, it is better if the dashboard can be fitted on a single screen rather than adjusting through a grid overlay.
