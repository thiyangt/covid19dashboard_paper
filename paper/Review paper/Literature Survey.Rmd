# Abstract

There are 221 countries & territories which are affected by the COVID-19 global pandemic as 20th of September 2021.To visualize the COVID-19 data & inform the general public, dashboards are the most commonly used visualization tool. The main objective of this study is to identify different features, visualization methods & improvements that should be occurred by exploring the existing dashboards. 15 different dashboards that have been developed to visualize the COVID-19 data for different countries & global has been explored here. Bar charts, line charts & Interactive maps are the most frequently used visualization tools in developing the dashboards. Dashboards that are fitted on a single screen is better than others.

<b>Key words</b> : COVID-19, Dashboard, Visualization

# Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic is the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The first
patient infected with COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. There have been reported 229835231 confirmed cases, 206515718 recovered cases, 18605877 active cases & 4713636 deaths in global as 20th September 2021. Currently 99.5% of active patients are mild condition and 0.5% of patients are in critical situation.

Dashboards are one of the best visual interpretation method of tracking the spread & communication of COVID-19 pandemic. There are so many COVID-19 visualization dashboards that have been created to visualize the global & local situation of pandemic. Real time updated COVID-19 dashboard created by the John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science & Engineering (JHU CSSE) has included total confirmed cases & total deaths by country, province/region/state (not for all countries)[6]. Weekly & daily global confirmed cases, deaths & vaccine doses have been visualized using bar plots related to the date in the side panels. Also, an interactive world map has included in the dashboard to represent total confirmed cases, incidence rate, fatality ratio & vaccine doses administered by country & state of US. All the links related to the data sets has been included in the dashboard. In this dashboard red, white, green colors has been used to indicate confirmed cases, deaths & vaccine doses respectively. The dashboard has fitted on a single screen.

Live updated “WHO COVID-19 dashboard” contained four panels. The interactive world
map in the dashboard has visualized the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths &
vaccination by country [15]. Line chart & bar charts have been used as visualization plots. Blue, red, green colors have been used to represent confirmed cases, deaths & vaccination respectively. The links related to the underlying data was available in the dashboard. The dashboard was not fitted on a single screen.

The “COVID-19 surveillance dashboard” created by the University of Virginia in
collaboration with Bio complexity Institute has included interactive world map with a time slide to visualize the confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths, active cases & vaccine details [7]. Line charts, bar charts & data tables have been visualized in the dashboard. Red, blue, green & yellow colors have been used to identify confirmed, deceased, recovered & active cases respectively. The data behind the dashboard also available on the dashboard & can be downloaded. The dashboard has fitted on a single screen.

Corona cases (COVID-19) per municipality in Belgium dashboard has included interactive
map for distribution of total confirmed cases per municipality, bar chart for number of cases per province, line charts for number of cases per day by region & municipality, dodge bar chart for deaths per region, per age & pie chart for deaths per age as visualization methods[3]. Also it included several value boxes for total cases, total deaths & hospital situations. There was no specific color theme used in this dashboard. This dashboard also fitted on a single screen.

The COVID-19 dashboard for England created by NHS providers included daily totals, daily changes & weekly changes in new cases, hospital admission, patients in hospital, and patients
in ICU beds, deaths & vaccinations in England as counts [2]. Bar plots for daily new cases, hospital admissions & deaths for last 30 days have been added in this dashboard. Also it has included data table for total count, daily changes (as increase or decrease), weekly changes (as increase or decrease) of new cases & hospital admission by region. It can be seen that, three different colors have been used in bar plot as orange for new cases, green for hospital admissions & red for deaths. These plots were not interactive plots & there was only one panel. The dashboard was not fitted on a single screen.

as overview, outbreak, source, international & ESR reports [10]. In this real time updated dashboard, they have included value boxes for total confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths & interactive map has been added for distribution of confirmed & probable cases as incidence & count. Also they have included bar charts for confirmed cases distribution by gender, age group, & line charts for confirmed & deaths as daily & cumulative. The dashboard has not fitted on a single screen.

Pakistan’s official COVID-19 dashboard is a real time updated dashboard with one panel. This dashboard contains value boxes for total confirmed cases, active cases, deaths, recovered
cases by country. Province wise cases have been represented by map & data table [11]. Line charts & bar charts have been added to visualize the distribution of cases related to time & province. In the value boxes blue, orange, pink & green colors have been applied for confirmed cases, active cases, deaths & recoveries respectively, but there was no specific color theme used when plotting the graphs. The dashboard cannot be seen on a single screen without grid overlay.

COVID-19 Canada live dashboard has been developed with three panels for provincial data, hospital resources & projections [14]. This dashboard contained interactive map for represented total reported cases & deaths by province. Data tables, line charts, bar charts were the most frequently used visualization types of this dashboard. More details were presented on this dashboard by province like ventilator counts, hospital beds per 100 residents, resource capacity based on critical case rate, effect of social distance, forecast of deaths & cases. There was no specific color theme applied for plotting the graphs. The dashboard also was not fitted on a single screen.

“Zoho analytics COVID-19 live dashboard” for India contained three panels as insight by state, trend analysis & vaccination [1]. Interactive country map has been used to visualize the distribution of confirmed cases, active cases, deaths, recovered cases & vaccination by states in India. Line charts, bar charts & doughnut shape pie charts have been used as other visualization tools. Also this dashboard contained data table for overview of COVID-19 in India. This dashboard also was not fitted on a single screen.

# Conclusion

Bar charts & line charts are the most frequently used tools for the visualization of total cases, daily cases & comparisons with respect to time. Some dashboards contained doughnut shape pie charts to summarize the total figures. In almost each and every dashboard, value boxes have been used to represent total figures. Some dashboards contained interactive maps & data tables to visualize the distribution of cases by country, province, region or state. The majority of the dashboards are daily updating real time dashboards. Gender, age groups and ethnicity can be identified as common breakdowns. The data sets & related links are available on most of the dashboards & can be downloaded. It can be seen that it is very easy, clear and user friendly to identify confirmed, recovered and deceased cases in dashboards which include one color theme for the whole dashboard. Dashboards with the dark background are comfortable to eyes than dashboards with light background & light colors. Also, it is better if the dashboard can be fitted on a single screen rather than adjusting through grid overlay.
